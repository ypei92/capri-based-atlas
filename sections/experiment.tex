\section{Experiment Methodology}
\label{sec:experiment}

In the experiment, we only consider single precision, real number matrix multiplication. We implement 
an exhaustive search on ATLAS. The space of each parameter in $NB$, $MU$, $NU$, $KU$ are not smaller 
than the ATLAS orthogonal search, and the exhaustive search tries every possible combination of them. 
On a typical platform as we mentioned in Section \ref{atlas_intro}, it takes more than 10 hours to finish 
the search on 12960 points.
