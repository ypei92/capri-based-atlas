\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this project, we adopts Capri to the search procedure of ATLAS. 
Capri is able to build a model to reduce the search time and predict high performance optimization parameters simultaneously.
Capri first takes the results of exhaustive search on many platforms and trains them offline. 
During the ATLAS code generation, it provides candidate parameters for ATLAS to run on the actual platform and pick the best.
\par
We evaluate the system on 12 platforms with 2 ARM and 10 Intel platforms. Our experiments show that over ATLAS orthogonal line search, Capri-based ATLAS search achieves an average of 10.9X speedup and the MFLOPS performance of generated code is 11\% higher. It only suffers 2\% performance degradation from best of exhaustive search.
