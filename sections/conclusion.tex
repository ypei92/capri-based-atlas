\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed Capri-based ATLAS. Original \atl suffers long
tuning time and performance issues. We adopt Capri, a new generation
approximate software designed for tradeoffs between
energy or runtime with error or performance for tunable programs, to ATLAS,
in order to accelerate the tuning process as well as better knob selection.
The orthogonal searching space of \atl is replaced by top knob candidates
generated by machine learning models built by Capri. \atl evaluates these
top knob candidates by actually running them and pick the knob setting with the
best actual performance.

We evaluated Capri-based \atl on 12 different platforms, including 2 ARM
platforms and 10 Intel platforms. Our experiments show
that Capri-based ATLAS achieves an average of 10.9X speedup in terms of
parameter tuning, while the generated code is 13\% faster than what original
\atl provides. Code generated by Capri-based \atl is only 2\% slower than the
code generated by global exhaustive searching strategy,
