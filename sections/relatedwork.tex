There are many heuristics on pruning the searching space and improving performance of auto-tuning.

ATLAS\cite{yotov2005search} uses orthogonal to reduce the search space. It assumes that 
the optimization parameters are independent to each other and they are restricted by some hardware features.
However as we have seen in the experiment, the assumption is not always true and its generated code
may have low performance. FFTW\cite{frigo2005design} adopts dynamic programming where program of large size problem
is constructed from previously generated code for small size. The inherent assumption of dynamic programming is that,
the best code of a transform is independent of the calling context. This assumption holds for the arithmetic cost (which implies
that DP produces the optimal solution), but not for the runtime of transform algorithms.
SPIRAL\cite{puschel2005spiral} not only adopts dynamic programs,
but also tries exhaustive search, random search, evolutionary search and hill climbing heuristic. The property 
of evolutionary search and hill climbing makes the generated solution may be local optimal.
