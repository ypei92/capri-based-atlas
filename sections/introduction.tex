\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A key step in program optimization is the estimation of optimal values for
parameters such as tile sizes and loop unrolling factors. Currently programmers
usually rely on optimization techiques provided by traditional compilers, which
is often too generalized to produce desired performance. General compilers
cannot take care of operations such as general matrix multiply(GEMM), whose
performance is heavily based on the how the programme is written and how the
parameter is set.
