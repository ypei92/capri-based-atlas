\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Optimization parameters of high performance programs must be tuned for a given platform. 
Auto-tuning is a straight-forward and one of the simplest way to find the optimal parameters.
Empirical search and model-based tuning are two major kinds of approach. 
Empirical search tries every data point in the parameter space and evaluate the performance of
them to get the optimal solution. 
However, exaustively searching the whole parameter space is slow and impractical. 
The search space is usually too large and contains lots of low performance points where
it is unneccesary to waste time. 
\par
Programmers with hardware and application knowledge can prune the space to reduce the search time.
ATLAS uses orthogonal line search to auto-tune its optimization parameters. 
It assumes that the parameters are independent to performance and the optimizal values can be 
restricted by some architecture features like number of registers, size of L1 cache.
