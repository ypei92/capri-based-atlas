  \subsection{ATLAS code generator}
  \label{sec:atlas_intro}
  ATLAS uses orthogonal line search to auto-tune its optimization parameters.
  It assumes that the parameters are independent to performance and the optimal values can be
  restricted by some architecture features like number of registers, size of L1 cache.
  Even though ATLAS empirical can generate good parameters, its search space is still not guaranteed to contain
  the optimal point, and there are still many low performance points in the search space which is unnecessary
  to search.
