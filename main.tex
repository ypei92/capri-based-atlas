\begin{abstract}

Auto-tuning is a general approach to find the optimal optimization parameters such as tile sizes in matrix multiplication.
There are two main approaches in auto-tuning: empirical search and model-based.
Empirical search is universal but slow, and some heuristic to reduce search space may prune out best solutions.
Model-based auto-tuning predicts the best parameters by platform abstractions but the performance can degrade.
\par
ATLAS uses orthogonal line search to find optimal parameters.
The search takes a long time and the space is not guaranteed to include the optimal points.
In this project, we introduce Capri-based ATLAS search, to reduce the search time and achieve high performance simultaneously.
Capri first takes the results of exhaustive search and trains them offline. During the ATLAS code generation, it provides candidate parameters for ATLAS to run on the platform and pick the best.
\par
We evaluate the system on 12 platforms. Our experiments show that  Capri-based ATLAS search achieves XXX speedup over ATLAS orthogonal line search and it only suffers YYY performance degradation.

  This work is based on ATLAS software and Capri project. The authors would
  like to thank Swarnendu(UTCS), Xin Sui(Tableau Software) and all the ATLAS
  developers.

  Yan Pei: I really enjoy this class. The course proves again that reading
  paper with discussion is be a great method of learning. I learned a lot
  during this class. The abstractions and high level ideas introduced in
  this class should be useful in my research career. On the other hand, I
  really wanna express my gratitude to Dr. Pingali and all my classmates.
  Thank you for preparing classes and presentations for us.

  Jiayuan He:
